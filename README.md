#### This implementation is done as a part of BSc graduate diploma for Applied Mathematics and Informatics study programme in the Financial University under the Russian Federation Government
#### It is written with OOP pattern and allows to run training process for the different combinations of:
* Intra-View model (with / without Hierarchy-Aware part) <br>
* Cross-View model (Cross-View Grouping / Transformation) <br>
#### Base models include:
* TransE <br>
* DistMult <br>
* HolE <br>
#### However, another simple models that are in OpenKE source code can be added.
